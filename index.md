<h1>Can we collaborate?</h1>

<h1>What witnesses do you recommend?</h1> 
Voting for witnesses on the Steem blockchain is a crucial part of maintaining decentralization and making sure things work properly. 
See my witness votes <a href="https://steemd.com/@mooncryption">here</a> or set <code>@mooncryption</code> as your proxy at the bottom of <a href="https://steemit.com/~witnesses">this page.</a>

I vote for witnesses with good tech specs, who are doing good things for our Steem community. You won't be disappointed!

<h3>Can I have <i>your</i> witness vote?</h3>
Sure, if you ask nicely :) There are also a few other requirements: 
<ul>
<li> You should post/comment/vote actively on the STEEM blockchain.</item>
<li> You must post an SBD/STEEM feed price frequently.</item>
<li> You should miss a very small amount of blocks.</item>
<li> You should post <code>Witness Updates</code> regularly.</item>
<li> You should review the latest hard-fork code from Steemit before approval.
<li> You should be easily reachable via Discord or Steemit.chat. 
<li> You must run a seed/RPC node. 
<li> You must be an active witness :P
</ul>

<h1>Can I contact you?</h1>
Yes! Our username is <code>@mooncryption#6603</code> on <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord.</a>
